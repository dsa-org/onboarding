# StatLink runthrough

First and foremost, we want you to get up to speed with our product. [Click here](https://www.statlink.io/login/MHDRF87/Manager) to sign up as a manager of our Sandbox team.

Once you are on the team, you should be able to run through the following tasks:

1. Create a new player. Name them after yourself, put up a photo, assign them a number and position, and then fill out the rest of the details however you'd like.
2. Go to the Evaluation card library and select a card to use on our team.
3. Go through the data collection process.
4. Take a look at your submission results once you finish and upload the data.
5. Take a look at the player rankings in the Analysis tab.

(WIP - I want to provide some step-by-step here to help the candidate better navigate through our dashboard).
